            <h1>How to Code</h1>

            <p>Learning how to code can be a daunting prospect.</p>

            <p>I know because when I first decided I wanted to learn how to code, I didn’t have the first clue where
                top start or what to do.</p>

            <p>It seemed impossible and I almost gave up.</p>

            <p>But I didn't.</p>

            <p>It took time, a lot of learning and tonnes of hard work, but I got the hang of it in the end.</p>

            <p>And let me tell you something: <strong>you can too</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Where to start learning how to code</h2>

            <p>There are tonnes of coding languages for you to learn out there right now.</p>

            <p>So the question you might ask yourself is: <em>where do I start?</em></p>

            <p>That’s a great question and the answer really depends on what kind of coder
                you want to be.</p>

            <p>Somebody who wants to learn how to code games will no doubt want to start someplace different
                than somebody who wants to code websites.</p>

            <p>In either case (or if you're not sure yet) and you're starting to learn how to code from scratch, I'd
                recommend building
                yourself a solid coding foundation first. A great place to start is: HTML.</p>

            <p>HTML stands for <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>
                and forms the basis of web pages and applications.</p>

            <div class="article_content_ad-right">
                <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                    src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=krisbarton-21&language=en_GB&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=1449363350&asins=1449363350&linkId=a42fb136a7c4df61d9278cd890c7914c&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>It works like this: web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet
                Explorer) are built to receive, interpret and display HTML pages from a web server or from your
                computer.</p>

            <p>The cool thing about HTML is that it can be greatly enhanced by other
                coding languages that have been built to work with it, most notably CSS and Javasctipt.</p>

            <p>But we'll get around to those other coding languages in another article.</p>

            <p>For now, we'll just be focusing on HTML and in the next section of this article I intented
                to show you just how easy is to build a web page.</p>

            <p>So if you think learning how to
                code may seem out of reach, I can assure you: it’s not.</p>

            <p>I’m going to show you how you can make a webpage right now on your computer
                and it’s going to take you 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

            <h2>Learn how to code: make a web page in 30 seconds</h2>

            <p>Making a basic web page is that easy you can do it right now in the 30 seconds on any computer.</p>

            <p>Here’s what you do:</p>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>

            <p>On your PC, open <strong>Notepad</strong>.
                Yes, just the plain old notepad application that comes with Windows, that’s all you’re going to
                need.</p>


            <h3>Step 2</h3>


            <p>Now here comes the code part. You don’t need to understand what this code
                does for the time being (I’ll explain it later), for now just copy the following into Notepad:</p>


            <blockquote class="article_code">
                <p>&lt;html&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>

            <p>In between the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tag, type in some text to
                identify the page. A standard in the coder world is the phrase "Hello Word" ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History">here’s
                    why</a>
                ), so in the example
                below I’ve used that. You can write whatever you'd like!</p>

            <blockquote class="article_code">
                <p>&lt;html&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Step 4 </h3>

            <p>Now it’s time to save the file so that it appears as a web page.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In your Notepad, click the <strong>File</strong> option and
                        then the
                        <strong>Save As </strong>
                        option.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Choose where you want to save your file
                        (it doesn’t really matter where!).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Delete whatever’s in the file name field
                        (it will probably be something like *.txt - because .txt is the standard notepad file extension
                        - see below).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/how-to-code-make-a-web-page-1.png" alt="How to Code | Learn HTML and Build a web page in 30 seconds | Save a Notepad txt file as an HTML web page screenshot" />

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Rename the file to whatever you would
                        like, but make sure you type .html at the end. For example: mywebpage.html.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Do you see the drop down labelled <strong>Save
                            as type?</strong>
                        It currently has a *.txt option
                        selected. Click the dropdown and select ‘all’ instead.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It look a little something like this:</p>

            <img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/how-to-code-make-a-web-page-2.png" alt="How to Code | Leanr HTML and Build a Page in less than 30 seconds | What saving a Notepad txt file as an HTML file should look like" />

            <p>Now all you have to do is click the <strong>save</strong> button and you’re done.</p>

            <h3>Let’s see what it looks like!</h3>

            <p>Go to the location where you saved the file and click on it. </p>

            <p>It should open in your default web browser (Chrome, Firfox, Internet
                Explorer or Safari) and it should just be a plain white webpage with "Hello World" written in black
                text.</p>

            <p>Congratulations! You’ve just created your very first web page - I told you
                it’d be easy!</p>

            <p>Now the hard part: let’s go a little more in depth on what that code meant.</p>

            <h2>How to code: understand the basics of HTML</h2>

            <p>The HTML we just used to create a webpage was a bare-bones example, but
                they are key elements to every website.</p>

            <p>Firstly, let’s take a look at HTML syntax.</p>

            <div class="article_content_ad-left">
                <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                    src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=krisbarton-21&language=en_GB&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=1840787546&asins=1840787546&linkId=f76855d41fdbf7976b4a016b43c832d4&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>A &lt; means you’re opening an HTML tag and a &gt;  means you’re
                closing it. Anything in between you’re telling the web browser to take as HTML code.</p>

            <p>So, when we started our webpage with &lt;HTML&gt; it means we’re telling
                the browser to take HTML as code. The &lt;HTML&gt; tag, as you might expect, is telling the
                browser to interpret this page as HTML.</p>

            <p>You might’ve also noticed at the end of the code there was a &lt;/HTML&gt;
                tag too. </p>

            <p>This is closing off the &lt;HTML&gt; tag and is basically telling
                the web browser to take everything between as HTML and everything after &lt;/HTML&gt; not to be HTML
            </p>

            <p>So, for the webpage we just made we’re telling it consider
                &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt; as HTML.</p>

            <p>Make sense?</p>

            <p>Let’s take a look at the HEAD tag next.</p>

            <h3>The HEAD tag</h3>

            <p>The HEAD tag handles information that is not displayed on the webpage. It’s
                official use is to store something called <strong>Metadata, </strong>
                which is basically data about the visible HTML on the page.</p>

            <p>One example is the &lt;title&gt; tag. This sets the text you see in the
                actual tab of your web browser.</p>

            <p>On this web page you're looking at right now, you should see all or some of
                "How to code | Marketing Coding" on the actual tab of your web browser. <strong>This is my HTML title
                    tag for this page</strong>.</p>

            <p>So lets set one on the web page we just created! In notepad, add &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
                in
                between the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt; tags.</p>

            <p>Now refresh your web page in your web browser and you should see My Web
                Page in the web browser tab.</p>

            <h3>The BODY tag</h3>

            <p>The BODY tag of an HTML web page contains everything you can actually see
                on your web page when you load it in a web browser.</p>

            <p>That’s why when we put Hello World between the opening &lt;BODY&gt; tag and
                closing &lt;/BODY&gt; tag we can see it our web browser.</p>

            <p>There are tonnes more HTML tags we can use within the BODY tag to improve
                how our web page looks, but we’re not going to go over all of them right now.</p>

            <p>I'll cover it all in later articles when I'll go into HTML in a little more depth - <strong>so make sure
                    you sign up to our
                    mailing list to get notified when I publish it!</strong></p>

            <p>Next, it's time to take a look at a coder's mentality and why it's important when learning how to code.</p>

            <h2>How to code: The coder’s mentality</h2>

            <p>It might surprise you, but one of the most useful abilities to have as a
                coder is good problem solving skills.</p>

            <p>Why? Because sometimes your code won’t work and you’ll have to figure out
                the reason why.</p>

            <p>It happens to us all.</p>

            <p>I’ve been coding in one form or another for 19 years and sometimes my code
                doesn’t work the first time round. I have to work through it and find out why too, but it’s honestly
                one of the reasons why I love to code.</p>

            <p>When you’re first starting it out, you’ll need to problem solve a lot. It
                comes with learn and you’ll definitely run into problems that you’ll need to solve. </p>

            <h3>Let me tell you a secret...</h3>

            <p>I need to tell you a little bit of a secret.</p>

            <p>I wish someone had told me this when I first started learning how to code
                and looking for coding jobs, because it would’ve calmed me down and made me feel a hell of a lot more
                confident in job interviews. </p>

            <p>The secret is this: potential employers value problem solving skills highly
                when hiring candidates for coding jobs.</p>

            <p>Sometimes they value it above coding knowledge.</p>

            <div class="article_content_ad-right">
                <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                    src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=krisbarton-21&language=en_GB&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=1908684577&asins=1908684577&linkId=aab391c31fdfd15c1acac77b7fd4c638&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>Now, that may sound a little strange, but it’s absolutely true.</p>

            <p>There’s tonnes of coding languages out there and most organisations
                regularly use a healthy mixture of them. </p>

            <p>When going for a coding role, you’re probably not going to know all of them
                inside and out and a potential employer won’t expect you to. </p>

            <p>What they will expect is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Problem solving skills.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An eagerness to learn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To be able to like you enough as a person
                        to be able to work with you.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>But I’m veering off topic a little.</p>

            <h3>Problem solving can be learned</h3>

            <p>If you don’t think you have good problem solving skills, don’t worry: it’s
                a skill that you can develop over time.</p>

            <p>It’s all part of learning how to code.</p>

            <p>Whenever you come across a coding problem, just run through these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Understand what you need to do.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Identify the problem.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Research.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Learn from your mistakes.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you follow these 4 rules when you’re having problems with your code,
                everything will soon fall into place.</p>

            <p>Let me go into a little more detail.</p>

            <h3>Understand what you need to do</h3>

            <p>If you you don’t fully understand what your trying to accomplish, then how
                do you even know whether the code you’ve written is wrong?</p>

            <p>Be clear on what you’re trying to accomplish with your code and then be
                clear on what the code you’re writing should do and how it works. </p>

            <p>When starting out, this alone solved more coding problems than I’d care to
                admit.</p>

            <h3>Identify the problem</h3>

            <p>With some coding languages, error messages are very clear; they’ll tell you
                what’s wrong with useful error messages and even give you a line number where you’ve gone wrong in your
                code. </p>

            <p>That’s not always to say it’s the root of your problem, but it’s certainly
                a starting point. </p>

            <p>From these clues, you can then investigate and help identify the problem.</p>

            <p>And identifying the problem is the first step in solving the problem: if
                you know what’s wrong, you can take the appropriate steps to resolve it.</p>

            <p>When you think about it, it’s the same for most problems in life, not just
                code.</p>

            <p>But I digress.</p>

            <p>Sometimes error messages aren’t that useful and you must work to identify
                the problem.</p>

            <blockquote class="article_quote">
                <p>Let me give you a little tip I’ve learnt over the years: if you find a
                    problem that isn’t obvious straight away, proofread your code first. </p>

                <p>And then do it again.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I’d say more that more than 60% of problems with my code over the years has
                been down to missing a semi-colon here, a comma there or something equally as trivial.</p>

            <p>True story and I bet I’m not the only coder out there</p>

            <p>It doesn’t happen so much with HTML for me anymore, but more complicated
                code? Absolutely.</p>

            <p>Most of the time, these errors are easily identified with a quick proofread
                and fixed within seconds, but it’s still incredibly annoying.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>

            <p>Your code isn't working properly; maybe you’ve identified the problem, maybe you
                haven’t.</p>

            <p>Either way, you just can’t work out what the problem is and you haven’t got
                a clue what to do next.</p>

            <p>Just do what the professionals do: research your problem.</p>

            <div class="article_content_ad-left">
                <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                    src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=krisbarton-21&language=en_GB&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=B01GCD5080&asins=B01GCD5080&linkId=86f2abe7771ec2e461d9f83d8ce796c9&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>You may have some really useful reference books you can refer to, but
                equally you may not have access to such material.</p>

            <p>In which case, the only thing to do is Google it.</p>

            <p>I’m not joking. </p>

            <p>Most developers Google answers to problems because you’re always guaranteed
                to find somebody out there with the same problem you’re experiencing.</p>

            <p>Of course, there’s a little more to it that to just Google it.</p>

            <p>You need to know exactly what to Google for, right? So what do you do then?</p>

            <p>Well, if there's an error message, just copy and paste that into Google. </p>

            <p>Nine times out ten, you’ll find someone else with that very same problem.</p>

            <p>But if you don’t have an error message, just try explaining the problem to
                Google.</p>

            <p>HTML not displaying correctly? Type that into Google. You may not find the
                solution to your particular problem directly, but I bet it’ll put you on the right track.  </p>

            <p>A really useful site to get answers is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>. It’s
                basically
                a place where coders having problems go to ask for help and people in the community offer solutions.
            </p>

            <p>It’s a really useful website because it has years and years of different
                problems stored for you to search through, but there’s an added bonus to using the website: <strong>if
                    you
                    can’t find the solution you’re looking for, you can just sign up to the website and ask a question
                    yourself.</strong></p>

            <p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

            <h3>Learn from your mistakes</h3>

            <p>If you’re a coder, you’re going to make mistakes.</p>

            <p>Not every piece of code you write will always work the first time around
                and as I mentioned above, some may be resolved by proof-reading and some may be resolved by research.</p>

            <p>Either way, you need to learn from your mistakes.</p>

            <p>Sometimes this means you’ll make sure you don’t make the error again, other
                times it may mean that if you do encounter the same error you’ll know exactly how to fix it - or at
                least how to debug it.</p>

            <p>This is a very important aspect of a coder’s job as it builds experience
                and improves the time it takes you to get coding done.</p>

            <h2>How to code: tips, tricks and resources</h2>

            <p>When I first started to learn how to code, I wish there was a a list of
                tips, tricks and resources available to help me get a jump start to become a coder.</p>

            <p>It was the early days back when I first started to learn how to code and
                both content and search engines were not nearly as advanced as they are now. </p>

            <p>It was a whole lot more difficult to find information you needed.</p>

            <p>Luckily for you guys starting out now, information is a lot easier to come
                and hopefully this article will be of some use in your journey.</p>

            <p>Especially this section of this article which blends together useful tips,
                tricks and resources to help jump start your coding progress.</p>

            <h3>Books</h3>

            <p>When I started my first coding job, I always had <a href="https://amzn.to/2Oiugbt" target="_blank">coding
                    books</a> on my desk. They were useful references
                and a bit of securtiy too: if I ever had a problem the answer was only a couple of pages away.</p>

            <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Oiugbt" target="_blank">Coding books</a> are also really useful when first
                learning concepts of the more difficult code, because
                often they require a totally new way of thinking than you're used to and I found that websites
                mostly failed to take that into account.
            </p>

            <p>I'm also just a whole lot more comfortable with physical books too, which of course was another deciding
                factor for me.</p>

            <p>If you're starting out, I'd recommened that you take a look at some of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Oiugbt"
                    target="_blank">coding books available</a>, even
                if you
                don't actually buy the physical copy, just the Kindle version.
            </p>

            <h3>W3 Schools</h3>

            <p>The first place you need to check out, is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3
                    Schools</a>. The site has been
                around forever and not only does it contain some really cool tutorials, but it’s really useful as a
                reference for all the coding tags and functions you will ever need.</p>

            <p>They also provide really cool demonstrations of how to use the code
                and allows you to play around with it too. </p>


            <p>W3 Schools also has a really cool <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">colour
                    picker tool</a>
                that allows you to select a colour and get a colour code.</p>

            <p>This is <em>really</em> useful when designing and developing websites and I find myself going
                here more and more as a new project starts.</p>

            <h3>StackOverflow</h3>

            <p>As mentioned in the above problem solving section, the StackOverflow
                website is really useful when you’ve got a problem and just can’t find the answer.</p>

            <p>The site is super searchable and if you can’t find what you need, you can
                always ask a question and get the help you need.</p>

            <h3>What code should I learn next?</h3>

            <p>Once you’ve learnt the basics of HTML, you might be wondering: <em>where
                    do I go next? </em></p>

            <p>It’s a great question.</p>

            <p>HTML is only the start of your journey. It’ll provide the structure in
                which you can use as a platform to build out both your web page and your coding knowledge.</p>

            <p>So what other coding languages should you learn next?</p>

            <p>The next coding languages you need to learn both build on your HTML
                foundation.</p>

            <p>The first code, CSS, will help you add colour, layout and basically make
                your webpage look better.</p>

            <p>The second code, Javascript, will help to make your website more
                functional.  </p>

            <p>I’ll got into a little more detail for these in future articles, but these
                are definitely the coding languages I’d recommend learning about next.</p>

            <h3>CodePen</h3>

            <p>The more you code, the more you’ll learn. There are tonnes of different
                codes and coding frameworks out there and it might feel a little overwhelming at first.</p>


            <p>That’s why I like <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> so much.</p>

            <p>CodePen is an online tools that allows you to code in HTML, CSS and
                Javascript, as well as allowing you to use the majority of coding frameworks.</p>

            <p>A coding framework may seem like a concept that’s totally beyond you at
                first, but the more you code, the more you’ll use them and realise why they are mostly a good
                idea.</p>

            <p>So starting out it’s okay to learn HTML  on your computer, just remember <a href="https://codepen.io/">
                    CodePen</a> is there in the future for when you’re learning something a little more advanced.</p>

            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>
                is also a great starting point for building up an online portfolio of your work that you can
                easily
                find, organise and link to at any opportunity. </p>

            <h3>Learning CSS</h3>

            <p>When you start learning CSS, you’ll be able to find a lot of the references
                you need to get started at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools
                </a>
                , as mentioned above it’s a really cool place to
                play around whilst you learn.</p>



            <p>But if you’re looking for something a little more advanced, then you should
                consider checking out <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">
                    CSS
                    Tricks
                </a>
                . </p>



            <p>They do a number of cool things with CSS and also show you how to do them
                in a really accessible way. They also write some really cool guides that I regularly refer to
                and find
                their site super useful.</p>

            <h3>Learning Javascript</h3>

            <p>Again, other than <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">
                    W3
                    Schools
                </a>
                <p>the main place I go to look Javascript is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">
                        MDN Web
                        Docs
                    </a>
                    .</p>

                <p>Their website is cool and really useful and not only do they give you great
                    reference material, but they do great tutorials too. I find their tutorials really easy to
                    follow, even
                    for the more complex stuff and would highly recommend making them a starting point for when you
                    start
                    to learn Javascript.</p>

                <h3>Smashing Magazine</h3>

                <p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">
                        Smashing Magazine
                    </a> is a cool website that keeps up with the latest design trends
                    and posts some
                    really cool articles.</p>

                <p>The website pretty covers everything you could ever hope for and it’s a
                    good idea to subscribe to their mailing list to keep up with their posts. </p>

                <p>Their website is also pretty cool to use and look at, so it’s clear from
                    the outset they know what they’re talking about.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                        <p>One of the best tools a coder has is a
                            problem-solving mentality.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A problem solving mentality can totally
                            be developed and is enhanced over time by coding experience.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Google and StackOverflow are the biggest
                            tools in a coders toolbox.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            there that can help you become a coder.</p>

                <blockquote class="article_quote">
                    <p>And on one final note, I’d like to repeat that although learning how to
                        code is hard, YOU CAN DO IT. </p>


                    <p>It just takes hard work, perseverance and the will to learn from your
                        mistakes.</p>
