            <h1>30 questions to ask in an interview</h1>

            <p>It’s the end of the interview and your potential employer asks: “have you
                got any questions?”</p>

            <p>Your mind goes blank.</p>

            <p>You know you need to ask <em>something</em>, but what? </p>

                under pressure, but let me tell you something: it gets easier with experience. </p>

            <p>It also gets easier when you know the secret of <em>why
                </em>you should ask questions during interviews.</p>

            <p>Let me explain.</p>

                    interview.
                </li>
                <li>

            <h2>Why you need to ask questions in an interview</h2>
            <p>The whole purpose of the interview process for a potential employer to <strong>sound you out</strong>.</p>

            <p>They want to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Whether you can actually do the job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether you’re suitable for the job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether they think you’ll fit well into
                    the team.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whether you’re the best candidate for the
                    job.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your aim during the interview is to prove to your potential
                employer that
                all four of these things are true.</p>

            <p>Finding the right questions to ask in an interview is a
                <em>big part of that</em>. </p>

            <p>But once you enter an interview knowing what a
                potential employer wants,
                finding the right questions to ask becomes a whole
                lot easier.</p>

            <p>Trust me.</p>

            <div class="article_content_ad-right">
                <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"

            </div>

            <p>It’s taken me dozens of interviews over the
                years to realise this, but once
                I did I found the interviews ran a lot more
                smoothly. There was a better flow, my
                confidence grew and I
                found my potential employer a lot more
                positive.</p>

            <p>That’s not always to say that I got
                every job I applied for - <strong><em>nothing
                        can guarantee that</em></strong>.</p>

            <p>There are reasons why you may
                not get a job and let me tell
                you: not all of
                them have anything to do with
                you.</p>

            <p>The hiring manager could
                leave, funding for the role
                could run out or even
                the need for the role could
                no longer be required.</p>

            <p>It’s true, I’ve seen it
                happen.</p>

            <p>So the best you can
                do is to optimise
                your chances.</p>
