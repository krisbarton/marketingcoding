            <h1 class="about_title">Hi, I’m Kris Barton.</h1>
            <h2 class="about_subTitle">And I provide expert Online Marketing and Coding training. </h2>
            <p>Over the years as a web developer, I’ve worked for large companies and small, in a variety of different
                industries. </p>
            <p>During the years, I also developed a passion for online marketing and through my efforts I saw many
                crossover points between the two practices.</p>
            <p>I saw how my coding abilities could benefit my online marketing efforts and visa versa and that’s when
                it struck me: <em>other people NEED to know this</em>.</p>
            <p>Marketing Coding was born and our goal is clear: provide expert training in both online marketing and
                coding.</p>

            <h2>But I’m a Coder, Why Do I Need to Know About Online Marketing?</h2>
            <p>I thought the exact same thing.</p>
            <p>When I put my first website online to earn a little money on the side, I naively thought people would
                just find my website. </p>
            <p>Needless to say, <em>that</em> didn’t happen. I had to learn how I could get people to visit my website,
                just like everybody else.</p>

            <h2>But I'm an Online Marketer, Why Do I Need to Know About Coding?</h2>

            <p>On the other hand, a number of online marketers will tell you how much of a benefit knowing how to code
                is.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It cuts costs.</li>
                <li>They could quickly and easily adapt their websites to meet your marketing needs.</li>
                <li>When they did want to outsource their coding requirements, they knew enough about coding to know if
                    they were getting a fair deal or if the developers code was up to standard.</li>
                <li>With <a href="/articles/what-does-seo-mean">SEO</a> favouring fast websites more and more, they
                    were able
                    to quickly optimize their website
                    for a better Search Engine performance.</li>
                <li>It added another string to their bow. - you can’t ever be too talented, right?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And that's just the <em>start</em> of the benefits.</p>

            <h2>The Internet Continues to Shape Our Future</h2>

            <p>The Internet isn't going anywhere. It's an integral part of our lives, our culture and our very
                existence.</p>
            <p>And it's growing.</p>
            <p>Surely, it only be a matter of time before <a href="/articles/how-to-code">you have to know how to code</a>
                to get by in online business.</p>
