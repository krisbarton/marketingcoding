                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry. That’s normal. It’s a big hurdle we all face

                                        read your great articles or buy your awesome products?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do a little research and come across people talking

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is important because ranking highly in these search

                                        deliver serious amounts of web traffic to your website. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This traffic is often referred to as </span><b>Organic

                        <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is SEO a Great Source of Traffic?</span></h2>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Levels of Traffic</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic Traffic from search engines is the main source of
                                        web traffic on
                                        the internet today. </span><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/seo-statistics/"
                                        tareget="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s estimated that a whopping
                                                51%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        of all web traffic comes from search engines. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">51%. Wowzers.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it makes sense. If you don’t know the exact website
                                        you’re looking,
                                        you’ll use a search engine to find what you need, right?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put that into context, it’s estimated that 10% of all
                                        traffic is
                                        generated by Paid Search, 5% from Social Media and 34% from other sources.
                                </span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeted Traffic</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is a great source of traffic because if done correctly
                                        it can
                                        regularly direct validated and targeted users to your website for free.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this mean?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re at the top of the search engine rankings for a
                                        particular
                                        term, it’s for a </span><b><i>very good reason</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means that the search engine believes that a particular
                                        page of your
                                        website is the most useful and relevant source of information for whatever
                                        query the user has
                                        searched for.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore if users visit your website and find what they’re
                                        looking for,
                                        the easier it’ll be to get them to spend more time on your website and convert
                                        them into customers,
                                        members or readers.</span></p>
                        <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do Search Engines Index and Rank Websites?</span></h2>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mechanics</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engines use Internet Bots called web crawlers (often
                                        called
                                        spiders or just crawlers) to search the Internet for websites to index.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the size of the Internet and the billions of websites
                                        that
                                        currently exist, not every single website or web page are indexed.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can make search engines aware of your website
                                        manually.</span></p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/webmasters/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank"><span
                                                style="font-weight: 400;">With
                                                Google, you can use its Search Console website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
                                </span><a href="https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whilst
                                                with
                                                Bing, you can use its Webmaster Tools website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, you can submit a sitemap and instruct Google and Bing
                                        to go crawl
                                        your site without having to rely on them finding of their own accord.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More on that later.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you have some idea of how search engines index your
                                        website, let’s
                                        take a look at how they rank your website.</span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine Ranking</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine Ranking is the order in which your website
                                        appears in the
                                        list of websites returned by a particular search query.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to have your website listed on the first page of
                                        Google
                                        results, preferably within the top 3 listings.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because the higher the ranking, the more traffic you’ll
                                        get. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do Search Engines rank websites? That’s a great
                                        question.</span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Algorithms</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engines rank websites using algorithms made up of
                                        many different
                                        factors they don’t really make public.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These algorithms change fairly regularly as search engines
                                        continually
                                        try to improve their service for their users and that doesn’t make it easy for
                                        people to try to
                                        rank highly.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are a lot of SEO experts out there who try
                                        and have seen
                                        pretty decent results over the years.</span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO History</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Search Engines first became a prominent part of the
                                        Internet,
                                        website owners quickly began to realize how important being indexed and ranked
                                        was.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of Search Engine Optimization was born.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early years, once website owners realized how Search
                                        Engines
                                        indexed and ranked website they, began to abuse the system. Soon, some searches
                                        were returning
                                        irrelevant, inconsistent or incomplete results.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, when Google first came along things changed. Their
                                        search
                                        rankings were based on more factors and by 2004 all Search Engines had adopted
                                        a more mature way
                                        ranking websites.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These undisclosed algorithms reduced manipulation by
                                        opportunistic
                                        website owners and greatly improved service to their users.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, these algorithms change regularly and methods
                                        that once
                                        worked no longer hold the same weight.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, SEO advisors urge people to focus on
                                        producing great,
                                        up to date and helpful content that Search Engines would naturally want to
                                        rank.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, this is the best way to be ranked highly and
                                        stay ranked
                                        highly in the long run.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite what certain "experts" might tell you, this
                                        can take
                                        time if you're starting from scratch. </span></p>

                        <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Does SEO Mean in 2018/2019? </span></h2>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018/2019 the SEO landscape has changed.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for relevant, detailed and useful content takes
                                        precedence in
                                        Search Engine rankings.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t get me wrong, good backlinks is still an important
                                        factor, but
                                        Search Engines are ultimately trying to provide a service. That service is
                                        getting people the most
                                        relevant and helpful websites that meet the requirements set in the search
                                        query. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Search Engine’s are continually changing their
                                        algorithms to improve
                                        their service.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does SEO mean in the future? Tailoring your website
                                        and content
                                        to meet user needs is the best way to approach SEO.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because the service provided by Search Engines isn’t
                                        going to
                                        change, but their algorithms do. They’ll continually improve them to be even
                                        more focused on
                                        delivering the best service it possibly can to their users.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means better content and a better website experience
                                        for the user
                                        too.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me explain.</span></p>

                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content Quality</span></h3>


                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time that a webpage could write 200 words on a
                                        subject and
                                        still rank on the first page of Google.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those days are behind us.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of SEO has become a lot more competitive and
                                        Search Engine
                                        algorithms have changed.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now articles are much more extensive and carry much more
                                        detail.</span></p>

                        <p><img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/seo_content.jpg" alt="A meme featuring Ron Burghundy declaring that content is kind of a big thing." /></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, SEO writers think nothing of publishing
                                        10,000-word articles
                                        on certain subjects.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you read that right. 10,000 words. Unbelievable.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is word count isn’t the bottom line when it comes
                                        to content.
                                        A number of SEO experts (such as </span><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/long-blog-articles/"

                                        style="font-weight: 400;">and
                                </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique-2-0" target="_blank"><span

                                        that quality and satisfying
                                        user intent are much better goals when writing articles.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? If you write a 10,000 words article and that article
                                        quality and
                                        relevance is garbage, then Search Engine’s aren’t going to rank it. Their
                                        algorithms are much more
                                        advanced than that.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking"
                                        target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BacklinkCo published an article
                                                of SEO stats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
                                        suggesting that the average first page Google results article length was just
                                        1,890 words.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is this: SEO articles must be detailed, useful and
                                        meet the
                                </span><b><i>user intent</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique-2-0"

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s user intent? Their main reason for performing a
                                        Search Engine
                                        search.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Search Engine algorithms have been optimized to get
                                </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        good at figure out
                                        user intent. After all, it’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the
                                        </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">main
                                        aspect of their service.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of user intent could be a user searching for “the
                                        best mobile
                                        phone”.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A user expects to see a comparison of mobile phone’s,
                                        rankings and
                                        recommendations.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they don’t expect to see is a really long and detailed
                                        article
                                        about one particular mobile phone’s features and capabilities.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has far more detailed content that might even be useful,
                                </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but it’s not what the user wanted to know</span></i><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what the best practice when writing content for SEO?
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your article is detailed but is relevant to what
                                        the user
                                        actually wants to know about. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s take a look a Backlinks.</span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinks</span></h3>


                        <p><img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/seo_backlinks.jpg" alt="A meme featuring Lionel Ritchie in the pursuit of backlinks" /></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who don’t know Backlinks even are, let me
                                        explain:
                                        Backlinks are simply links to your website from other websites. These might be
                                        other articles
                                        referencing your work or even shares on social media.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are important for SEO because it tells Search Engines
                                        that users
                                        value your content. If people are linking to it, it must be valuable.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the value of Backlinks was eventually figured
                                        out by
                                        website owners was consequently exploited by utilizing nefarious techniques.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engine’s reacting, updating their algorithms to fight
                                        the abuse,
                                        but not to remove the value of Backlinks altogether. Therefore, “good
                                        Backlinks” – the links to
                                        your website from real and natural sources – are still valued highly by Search
                                        Engines. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking"
                                        target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinkco’s research suggests</span></a><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        that “good backlinks” can improve something called Domain Authority and that
                                        can significantly
                                        affect the ranking of an article.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why’s this so important? Well, Domain Authority basically
                                        means how much
                                        Search Engines consider your website as a whole the authority on the particular
                                        subject your
                                        website is covering.</span></p>
                        <p><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinkco
                                                also
                                                determined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the overall
                                        domain authority matter
                                        more in rankings than the article ranking itself.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this means an incredibly detailed and well-written on a
                                        website that
                                        doesn’t have domain authority isn’t going to rank as well as a lesser article
                                        written by a website
                                        with domain authority.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the more you grow your domain authority by
                                        getting
                                        backlinks to a particular article, the more other pages of your website will
                                        rank.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very interesting stuff.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s take a look at what role a fast-loading website
                                        has in Search
                                        Engine rankings.</span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website Speed</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search Engines consider a websites load speed a big factor
                                        when
                                        determining rankings.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html"
                                        target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google publicly announced as
                                                much back in 2010</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        and </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank"><span
                                                style="font-weight: 400;">Backlinkco’s
                                                analysis of high-ranking websites confirms it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why? Why would web page speed have anything to do with
                                        Search Engine
                                        Rankings?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Search Engine’s know full well that if a web page
                                        takes too long
                                        to load, a user is going to click the back button before they even read a
                                        single word.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a bad experience for the user and bad user
                                        experiences when
                                        searching is precisely what Search Engine’s want to avoid. </span></p>
                        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTTPS</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another deciding factor for page ranking in 2018 and 2019 is
                                        the use of
                                        SSL certificates to gain an HTTPS connection for your website.</span></p>
                        <p><a href="https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html"
                                        target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google
                                                has previously stated that it’s a ranking signal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        and
                                        continues to push more and more websites to adopt HTTPS.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Search Engine’s favor HTTPS? Because it ensures a more
                                        secure
                                        experience (and peace of mind) for the user.</span></p>
