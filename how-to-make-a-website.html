                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I get into the article, let first let me explain
                                        precisely why
                                        I’m in
                                        a position to help you decided the best way to make your first website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a web developer by trade and have been for around 19
                                        years.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve built websites from scratch, I’ve set them up on
                                        various content
                                        platforms and website builders and I’ve used tonnes of different code
                                        frameworks along the way.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum it up: I know my stuff and I can certainly teach you
                                        how to make
                                        a
                                        website.</span></p>
                        <h2 id="whatisawebsite"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So What Exactly is a Website?</span></h2>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I got into detail about how to make a website, let me
                                        start at
                                        the
                                        beginning by defining what a website actually is.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Website consists of one or more web pages, usually written
                                        in HTML or
                                        some
                                        other comparable code, and can contain different types of coding languages and
                                        multimedia (such as
                                        images, video or even audio).</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A web page can generally be viewed on a computer or device
                                        via the web
                                        browser and only becomes available when your web page is published on a web
                                        server and assigned a
                                        domain name.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A web server is basically a computer that can be accessed
                                        via the
                                        internet.
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A web server’s sole job is to serve up web pages to anybody
                                        trying to
                                        access
                                        it using something called Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP for short. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why when you try to go directly to a website in your
                                        browser, you
                                        started with HTTP (or these days HTTPS) – this is the way the web page is
                                        communicated between your
                                        computer and the web server.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinda makes sense, right?</span></p>
                        <h3 id="webhosting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Hosting</span></h3>

                        <img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/how-to-make-a-website-web-hosting.jpg" alt="Rows of IMGIX webservers. This is web hosting." />

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get your website onto a web server, the standard
                                        route is to
                                        use
                                        a web hosting company. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a web hosting company, you are essentially ‘renting
                                        out’ space on
                                        their
                                        web servers. Prices and options vary of course, but with using a web hosting
                                        company there are a
                                        number
                                        of great benefits. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll get into some of the other benefits later, but the most
                                        notable
                                        benefit
                                        you get a free </span><b>domain name</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
                                </span></p>
                        <h3 id="whatwebhosting"><span style=" font-weight: 400;">So What Web Hosting can You
                                        Recommend?</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me give you a piece of advice about Web Hosting: get it
                                        right the
                                        first
                                        time to avoid headaches later.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tell you this from a pretty chequered experience with web
                                        hosting in
                                        the
                                        past. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first learnt how to make a website and tried to get
                                        it online,
                                        the
                                        first web hosting company I signed up with promised the world and delivered
                                        nothing. I mean, you
                                        couldn’t even run WordPress on there (despite advertisements suggesting you
                                        could).</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My next web hosting company decided to do maintenance which
                                        completely
                                        obliterated one of my WordPress websites.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reported it and three days later, they responded by
                                        telling me
                                        changing my
                                        WordPress them back to factory settings fixed the issue on their web servers.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As developer let me tell you: &nbsp;that makes no kind of
                                        sense and
                                        those
                                        support guy decided he’d gone into the database of my website and play around.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience alone cost me so much money, I just had to
                                        move to new
                                        web
                                        hosting. I mean, that wasn’t even in question. I spoke with the web hosting
                                        company and got them to
                                        give me a full refund for hosting services to before their server update
                                        brought down my website
                                        and I
                                        moved to new hosting.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that cost me a tonne of revenue and I wasn’t compensated
                                        a single
                                        penny
                                        of that. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I decided to move my websites to a hosting company
                                        recommended to me
                                        by a
                                        few entrepreneurs and I haven’t had a single problem since.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hosting company is </span><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/geekzeni/"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluehost</span></a><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        and I would highly recommend them.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we’ve got web hosting covered, let’s take a closer
                                        look at
                                        domain
                                        names.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="domainname"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s a domain name?</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s basically your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">website’s
                                                address</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It tells people
                                        where they can find your
                                        website once it’s been connected to the internet from the web hosting. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, like what you type into the address bar of your
                                        web browser
                                        such
                                        as google.com or bbc.co.uk? Those are domain names.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get to pick your own name (provided it isn’t already
                                        taken) and then
                                        choose an extension such as .com, .co.uk or .org etc.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important that you remember that when getting a domain
                                        name you’re
                                        getting it with solely the extension you first choose. If you want the same
                                        name with a different
                                        extension, then you’d have to pay an extra fee.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you wanted your website to be called
                                        TerrysCupcakes (FYI
                                        – I
                                        have no idea whether that name is taken or not, it was just an example off the
                                        top of my head),
                                        you’d
                                        have to pay twice for TerrysCupcakes.com and TerrysCupcakes.co.uk.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also know that getting a domain name isn’t a
                                        one-off
                                        purchase.
                                        Much like web hosting, you’re only ‘renting out’ the name and if you do not
                                        renew it, you lose all
                                        rights to it.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry, the domain companies often give you plenty of
                                        warning that
                                        the
                                        domain name is going to expire. Also, renting out the domain name isn’t always
                                        expensive. Depending
                                        on
                                        the domain and the domain company, there are always discounts you can take
                                        advantage of.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, right now I saw on GoDaddy.com that a .com
                                        domain name
                                        would
                                        cost around $12.17 for the first year. A .co.uk would costs just $0.99 a year
                                        for the first 2
                                        years,
                                        which is pretty good if you have a website that’s only relevant for UK
                                        residents.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="buydomainname"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do you buy your domain names from?</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a great question.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let me remind you that </span><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/geekzeni/"><span
                                                style="font-weight: 400;">if you sign up for web hosting with Bluehost
                                                you’ll get a free domain
                                                name</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so I’d definitely
                                        recommend taking advantage
                                        of
                                        that for your first website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But where do I go to buy more domain names? I usually use
                                        GoDaddy.
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because their method to redirect the domains to
                                </span><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/geekzeni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluehost
                                                web hosting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is
                                        easy
                                        and they often have great deals.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure most other domain name companies have the same kind
                                        of deals,
                                        but
                                        I’ve had such a great customer experience with GoDaddy that I don’t really
                                        bother looking around
                                        for
                                        anything else. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that I’ve established what domain names are, let’s take
                                        a look at
                                        something else you’ll need to think about before pulling the trigger on making
                                        a website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you learn how to mate a website, what are you going to
                                        use it for?</span></p>
                        <h3 id="differentuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Websites for Different Uses</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to be clear on what you want to use your
                                        website for.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great way to determine <strong>how</strong> you
                                        are going to
                                        make
                                        your website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you want a site that’s going to be a blog or
                                        have
                                        regularly
                                        updated content, then software such as WordPress, Drupal or Joomla would
                                        probably be your best
                                        option
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you just wanted a couple pages in which the content
                                        rarely changes,
                                        you
                                        might want to try Wix, Squarespace or even building the website yourself.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wanted to open an online store, you might look at
                                        Shopify or
                                        Magento.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve mentioned quite a few options for you to consider there
                                        and it’s
                                        worth
                                        going over them in a bit more detail.</span></p>
                        <h2 id="options"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So What Are My Options?</span></h2>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is you have tons of options available to you when
                                        making your
                                        website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ways are faster than others.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ways are cheaper than others.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ways are more complicated than others.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some doing certain things better than others.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be a real minefield if you don’t a plan for your
                                        website and
                                        haven’t
                                        done your research first.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll go through some of the most popular options available
                                        to you, break
                                        them down and compare them to make sure you can see the whole picture.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, it’ll make your decision a whole lot easier to
                                        make.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let’s take a look at </span><b>Content Management
                                        Systems</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="cms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s a Content Management System?</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Content Management System (often referred to as a CMS for
                                        short) is
                                        essentially software that’s installed on a web server and it allows a website
                                        to manage, store and
                                        display content.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After installation, there’s a dashboard that you can log in
                                        to that will
                                        enable to change the look and feel of your website, install add-ons and tool to
                                        make your life
                                        easier
                                        and you can also create and publish content for your audience.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, your hosting company will have easy installers
                                        for these
                                        Content
                                        Management Systems available to you after sign-up.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Bluehost user, I can easily and quickly install quite a
                                        few
                                        different
                                        Content Management Systems from my hosting control panel. Pretty cool, right?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t really answer the question of which Content
                                        Management
                                        System you should use though, does it?</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress is a blogging platform that’s also a fantastic
                                        content
                                        management
                                        system.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what’s the difference between a blogging platform and a
                                        content
                                        management system? Where Wordpress is concerned, not much. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blogging platform is software that helps you build just a
                                        blog for you
                                        to
                                        write thoughts, information, and news whereas a content management system is a
                                        design to allow you
                                        to
                                        easily create web pages.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wordpress does both and does both well; one of the reasons
                                        why it has
                                        such a
                                        large market share of all content management systems on the Internet right now.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reason is: it’s versatile. You can set up WordPress
                                        in three
                                        different ways:</span></p>
                        <ol>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can buy Web Hosting
                                                with a hosting
                                                company like </span><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/geekzeni/"><span
                                                        style="font-weight: 400;">Bluehost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                                and install it that way.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can go to <a href="http://Wordpress.com">WordPress.com
                                                </a>and set up a blog and pay for hosting there.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can go to <a href="http://Wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>
                                                and set up a blog for free there (with much less functionality).</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, WordPress offers a lot of cool ways to use
                                        their
                                        software,
                                        you just need to choose which best suits you.</span></p>
                        <h4 id="wordpresswhichway"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which way of using Wordpress is the
                                        best?</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to use Wordpress software really depends on
                                        what you want
                                        your
                                        website to be.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you just want a free space online to write your thoughts,
                                        stories or
                                        anything else that comes into your head as a hobby, then absolutely use the
                                        free version. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the free version you can’t assign your website
                                        a proper
                                        domain
                                        name of your choosing, you’ll just get something like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yoursitename.wordpress.com
                                                &nbsp;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(if it’s available).
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your website is for a hobby only, then that’s not an
                                        issue. It’s when
                                        it
                                        becomes more for business issues arise. People are wary of buying from a
                                        website that doesn’t seem
                                        professional and not having your own domain name is a big indicator of that.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the good thing with WordPress hosting is that if
                                        you start out
                                        with
                                        a hobby blog and want to make it more professional and business-like at a later
                                        date, you can
                                        totally
                                        upgrade to the paid version really easily.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other things with free WordPress hosting is that
                                        WordPress still
                                        maintain the right to advertise on your website. This is wasted website real
                                        estate and what’s
                                        worse is
                                        you don’t really get control of the ads and you certainly don’t get any of the
                                        revenue.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting paid WordPress hosting from the start if you know
                                        you’re only
                                        going
                                        to use one website and you know WordPress is right software for you. You can
                                        get a domain and host
                                        your
                                        new WordPress website on r<a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/geekzeni/"

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a pretty good deal, right?</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works out much cheaper than paying for multiple WordPress

                                        style="font-weight: 400;"> comes

                                        tons of tools that I need to run my business. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, this is the option if you’re starting out with
                                        the aim to
                                        be a

                        <h4 id="wordpressexperience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Experience with Wordpress</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve used WordPress before and it’s absolutely fantastic. As
                                        a web
                                        developer
                                        by trade it’s a dream. They have a great framework for you to build your
                                        website on, which has
                                        brilliant documentation.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a non-technical user it’s even better. You can make a
                                        website in 3
                                        minutes, pick a theme (free or otherwise) to style it how you’d like and get
                                        cool plugins to make
                                        your
                                        life a lot easier.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the other options on the list, Joomla or Drupal are
                                        the most
                                        similar
                                        to Wordpress. Technically WordPress’ prime function is to be blogging software
                                        BUT it’s also really
                                        good at content management too.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it does both things it makes it that much better
                                        than Joomla and
                                        Drupal and I think that’s one of the reasons WordPress is used more.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I personally haven’t felt the need to use Joomla and
                                        Drupal after
                                        using WordPress. WordPress does everything I need it to and I see no reason to
                                        jump to anything
                                        else.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take all of those reasons into account, it becomes
                                        pretty
                                        obvious
                                        why I’ll only be doing a thorough run-through of how to make a WordPress
                                        website a little later in
                                        the

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s take a look at two other content management
                                        platforms that
                                        compete
                                        with WordPress’ online subscription model.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consider Squarespace, Wix, and WordPress.com in the

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because they essentially offer the same options and the

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s take a look at what you’re options are if you

                                        need a

                        <p>What if you want to learn how to make a website to sell things? What’s the best option for
                                you then?</p>
                        <p>Well, Shopify immediately springs to mind.</p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is a content management system that specialises in
                                        e-commerce
                                        websites and us perfect for people who want to make their website an online
                                        store</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers a good, well-supported solution for an online
                                        e-commerce
                                        store, but also offers blog technology to sweeten the pot (as well some other
                                        cool benefits that
                                        would
                                        greatly benefit a shop owner).</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realistically, you would only really need to consider this
                                        option if you
                                        wanted your website to be primarily an online store right from the beginning.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure at first, but think it could be the way
                                        to go at some
                                        point in the future, then WordPress still might be your best option. Why?
                                        Because you can find
                                        numerous
                                        plugins (some free and some not) that will help transform your blog into a
                                        store any time you want
                                        to.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="magento"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Make a Website with Magento</span></h3>

                        <img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/how-to-make-a-website-magento-logo.png" alt="The Magento logo" />

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento is also an e-commerce solution, but if you’re just
                                        starting out
                                        I’m
                                        not sure it’s the best choice out there.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Shopify, it’s primary function is to allow users
                                        to easily
                                        create
                                        and manage an online store.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One difference between the two option is that Magento’s
                                        website isn’t
                                        nearly
                                        as accessible to the beginner as Shopify’s is and seems to geared more towards
                                        businesses wanting
                                        to
                                        create a good online e-commerce presence. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no pricing options evident on the website, nor is
                                        there a list
                                        of
                                        features like there is with Shopify.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the two options, it seems obvious to me that if
                                        you’re learning
                                        how
                                        to make a website and you know for sure you want it to be an online store,
                                        Shopify is definitely
                                        the
                                        better solution out of the two.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="leadpages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to make a Website with Leadpages</span></h3>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your quest to learn how to make a website, depending on
                                        your needs,
                                        you
                                        might not need a content management system to accomplish your goals.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you just need a one page website to get a visitors
                                        email address
                                        or
                                        just for a sales page? A content management system could be overkill for that
                                        scenario.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a solution like <a href="//leadpages.pxf.io/c/1320344/466534/5673"
                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadpages </a>could be just what you
                                        need.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is <a href="//leadpages.pxf.io/c/1320344/466534/5673"
                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadpages</a> great for a one page site,
                                        but they specialise in sales and lead
                                        sign
                                        up pages, so you can be sure your pages are optimised to convert. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the other benefits of using <a href="//leadpages.pxf.io/c/1320344/466534/5673">Leadpages</a>,
                                        taken straight from their website:</span></p>

                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to integrate with

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty cool, right?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do have to pay to use <a href="https://leadpages.pxf.io/c/1320344/466534/5673">Leadpages</a>
                                        and there are a couple of different pricing options (which start at $25 a
                                        month), but it could be
                                        well-worth the price for high converting leads and/or sales.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re still not sure, they do offer a free 14 day
                                        trial so you
                                        can
                                        see if dramatically increases your conversions as it has done for previous
                                        customers. </span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe you just want to learn how to make a website
                                        yourself? You’re
                                        interested in code and want to go out there and build something.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good on you!</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be a cheaper solution than some as you would just
                                        need to pay for
                                        web
                                        hosting (again, I’d heartily recommend Bluehost) and a domain name (but you get
                                        a free one with
                                        Bluehost) so that people can access your website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you’re just starting out, you can absolutely do it.
                                </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s just going to take you a little longer to get up and

                                        using

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think after reading this article you pretty much get the
                                        picture why
                                        WordPress is such a popular piece of software and is as widely used as it is
                                        across the Internet
                                        right
                                        now.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also the reason why I’m going to include a guide to
                                        install
                                        WordPress
                                        on Bluehost, should you feel this option is the best for you.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to go through the process of setting up a blog
                                        on
                                        WordPress.com because, quite frankly, that website has such good user
                                        experience it’s pretty
                                        self-explanatory. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for Shopify and Leadpages.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst setting up WordPress on Bluehost is still pretty easy
                                        when you’re
                                        following instructions or have done it before, it can be tricky if this is the
                                        first time you’ve
                                        made a
                                        website.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see from the image above, </span><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/geekzeni/"><span
                                                style="font-weight: 400;">Bluehost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        offer 3 different
                                        hosting packages.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect that you’ll only need the basic package to start
                                        with, but if
                                        you
                                        do want to host multiple websites and have unlimited website space you might
                                        want to consider the
                                        plus
                                        option for just $1 more a month.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you do start with the basic package and want to
                                        upgrade
                                        later,
                                        then you can absolutely do that.</span></p>

                                        style="font-weight: 400;"> support (they’re totally awesome).</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, it’s time to give the installer information about your
                                        website.</span></p>
                        <p><img class="article_content_img" src="../assets/how-to-make-a-website-wordpress-site-information.png"

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the installation requires the following:</span></p>
                        <ol>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of your site.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your username.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your password.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it’s just a matter of ticking the standard
                                        authorisation options.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is to confirm you want this install to create a
                                        new database
                                        for
                                        your account. WordPress needs a database in order to work, so this is pretty
                                        much essential.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is to confirm that any files within the directory
                                        you’re
                                        installing WordPress will be overwritten. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re creating a website from scratch, this is nothing
                                        to worry
                                        about.
                                        If you’re replacing an existing website with a WordPress one, then make sure to
                                        make backups of
                                        anything you may want to keep.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third is just a standard terms of service.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re happy with everything, click the Install button.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a couple of seconds, your WordPress installation
                                        should be
                                        complete.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also receive an email confirming your
                                        installation has been
                                        successful.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email will also contain a link to your WordPress admin
                                        panel, where
                                        you
                                        can log in and begin playing around with some of WordPress’ settings. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your first stop: setting up your WordPress site the right
                                        way.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="setupwordpress"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up your WordPress Website</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress allows you to configure a ton of settings that
                                        will help you
                                        set
                                        up your website the best way you see fit.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best place to start is on the WordPress Settings page,
                                        you can find
                                        in
                                        the admin section of WordPress after you’ve logged in.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should see a link in the left-hand navigation panel with
                                        the name
                                </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
                                        Click
                                        this link and
                                        the General Settings page should load up.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s where you get started. </span></p>
                        <h4 id="websitename"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website name and description</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you have major concerns about the Timezone of your
                                        new website or
                                        how
                                        the date and time are formatted, the only place you really need to start is
                                        with the first two
                                        options
                                        on the page: the Site Title and Tagline options.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important you change these (if they’re not already done
                                        automatically
                                        by the installation process) because some WordPress themes use these fields to
                                        display information
                                        about your site on your web page as default.</span></p>
                        <h4 id="configure"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure your Permalinks</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A permalink is how WordPress links your website address to
                                        each page and
                                        article.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you click the permalinks link in the settings navigation,
                                        you’ll be
                                        able
                                        to see 6 different permalink options.</span></p>
                        <ul>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plain (which is the
                                                standard setting) and
                                                just uses a page/post number to link to your page. This looks quite
                                                nasty and doesn’t provide a
                                                user of your website with much information about what content the page
                                                will actually contain.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day and name is good
                                                because it at least
                                                tells you the name BUT I prefer not to leave the date in the URL. Why?
                                                Because the date in the
                                                URL
                                                can make the page seem old and dated even if you’ve recently updated
                                                the content.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Month and name is the
                                                next option and has
                                                pretty much the same benefits and faults as the date and name option.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numeric allows you just
                                                post numbers to
                                                link
                                                to your content. It’s slightly nicer than the plain option, but it
                                                still has the same problem
                                                of
                                                not being very helpful to the user in describing what contain the page
                                                contains.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post name is my option of
                                                choice. This
                                                just
                                                displays the name of your post in the URL and gives users a great idea
                                                of what the article is
                                                going
                                                to be about, without dating it </span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom. Here you can tell
                                                WordPress how
                                                you
                                                want it to structure your WordPress URLs. This is a great option, but I
                                                don’t recommend you go
                                                down
                                                this road for your first website unless you know what you’re doing.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to sort out your permalink when you initially
                                        set-up
                                        because
                                        changing them at a later date can be a massive pain.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because all of you links have now changed so anywhere
                                        you may have
                                        posted your link (like on social media) will now have an incorrect link and
                                        will cause errors.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust me, it’s easier to get it right from the start.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="wordpresslookgood"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Make your WordPress Website
                                        Look Good</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now that you’ve configured your WordPress website, the
                                        next step is
                                        to
                                        make it look good.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In WordPress, you can change the look of your entire website
                                        in just a
                                        couple of clicks – it really is that easy. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are called </span><b>themes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        and
                                        if
                                        you click on the Appearance link in the WordPress admin dashboard there should
                                        be a sublink aptly
                                        called </span><b>themes </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you click on
                                        this you will see your
                                        theme options.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As standard, WordPress comes with a built-in theme already
                                        selected.
                                        This is
                                        a pretty decent design, but it’s not something you have to stick with.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of different WordPress themes out there for
                                        literally
                                        any
                                        kind of website. From newspaper-like layouts to more corporate-like layouts,
                                        you’ll be able to find
                                        something that fits what you need perfectly.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you have plenty of options of how to get your WordPress
                                        theme.
                                        You’ve
                                        got four different options:</span></p>
                        <ol>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free WordPress themes.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium WordPress themes.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a web developer to
                                                make a WordPress
                                                theme for you.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make your own WordPress
                                                theme.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at those options in a little more detail.</span></p>
                        <h4 id="freethemes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Options</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find, select and install free themes in the themes
                                        section of
                                        your
                                        WordPress admin dashboard.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are very well-designed and could very well suit your
                                        purposes
                                        well.</span></p>
                        <h4 id="premiumthemes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid For Options</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can’t find a free WordPress theme that meets your
                                        needs, you
                                        could
                                        buy a premium theme.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of places you can buy premium themes, but
                                        I’ve found
                                        that
                                        Mojo Marketplace has a great selection of themes to choose from. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different options for purchasing premium themes
                                        and some can
                                        get
                                        pricey. My advice is: just make sure you shop around and be sure to choose the
                                        option that’s best
                                        for
                                        you.</span></p>
                        <h4 id="hiresomeone"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire Someone</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you just can’t find a WordPress theme that you love
                                        or you’ve
                                        seen
                                        one you like the look of, but doesn’t quite fit what you need it to do?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, you could hire someone to make a WordPress theme for
                                        you. There
                                        are
                                        plenty of freelance developers out there who would be able to create a custom
                                        WordPress theme to

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay,so what if you can’t find a theme that meets your
                                        requirements, but
                                        at
                                        the same time you don’t have enough startup money to hire a developer to create

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you could make your own WordPress theme?</span></p>

                                        go through how you
                                        can
                                        make a WordPress theme and I’m alway here to help if you have any questions.</span></p>

                                        might be
                                        worth
                                        it if the custom WordPress theme delivers like you hope it should.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, let’s take a look at essential WordPress plugins that

                                        your
                                        life a lot easier.</span></p>
                        <h3 id="wordpressplugin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s a WordPress Plugin?</span></h3>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress plugins are add ons you can install on your
                                        WordPress website
                                        to
                                        help enhance the functionality of your blog.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plugins come in many forms and do many things, some of which
                                        can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through all my years of using WordPress for my websites,
                                        I’ve found 5
                                        that I
                                        can’t live without and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh. Did I mention </span><b><i>they’re all free</i></b><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">?
                                        Let’s take a look at them in a bit more detail.</span></p>

                                        style="font-weight: 400;">powerful
                                        tool to have in your arsenal.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because it can speed up your website immeasurably,
                                        which provides a
                                        great experience for people visiting the website and helps you to get your
                                        website in Google
                                        searches
                                        and rank well.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works by storing you unchanged images and code on the
                                        user’s web
                                        browser,
                                        meaning the next time the user goes to your website it loads up a lot faster.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty cool, huh?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, something to further help your website get onto

                                        helps you with Search
                                        Engine
                                        Optimization – the art of getting your website ranking highly in Search engines
                                        (like Google or
                                        Bing)
                                        search results..</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is that important? Because it helps you get readers to
                                        your blog,
                                        but I
                                        won’t go into too much detail about that right here.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, </span><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/"><span
                                                style="font-weight: 400;">Yoast SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">

                                        purposes.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A REALLY useful tool to have.</span></p>
                        <h5 id="googlexml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google XML Sitemap</span></h5>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/"

                                                Sitemap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                                        is another essential WordPress plugin, even though it may not seem like it at
                                        face value.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plugin will essentially generate an XML page with every
                                        single
                                        WordPress page and blog post you have published on your website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also keep updating that sitemap every time you
                                        publish a new
                                        page or
                                        blog post too.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is this important? Because this XML sitemap is used by
                                        Google (if
                                        you
                                        set it up in the Google Search Console service) to check and then index a page
                                        or blog post in
                                        their
                                        search results.</span></p>
                        <h5 id="wpsmush"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WP Smush</span></h5>
                        <p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span

                                                Smush</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a WordPress plugin
                                        that helps you optimize
                                        your
                                        website images.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does that mean? The plugin will try to reduce the image
                                        file size
                                        without reducing the image quality (too much).</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is really useful because it helps your website pages
                                        load faster
                                        and
                                        that improves user experience on your website as well as helping you with SEO.</span></p>

                                        plugin does exactly what it says on the tin – provides you with the option to
                                        backup your entire
                                        WordPress website.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would you need to do this? Say for example your website
                                        was
                                        maliciously
                                        hacked and the hacker tried to delete your data, you could easily get the
                                        hosting company to dump
                                        that
                                        site and use your backup to get your website back online quickly. </span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or if you accidentally delete your website database?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or if you want to move your website to a different hosting
                                        company (not
                                        that
                                        you’d ever want to Bluehost), but what if you wanted to for some reason?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or what if you wanted to take a copy of your WordPress site
                                        and install
                                        it
                                        locally on your PC so that you could try things out (such as building your own
                                        WordPress theme etc)
                                        offline?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, that’s what I use it for mostly. It makes life
                                        easier in the
                                        long
                                        run, even if you don’t find an immediate use for it.</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty cool, huh?</span></p>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s take a look at how you can install a WordPress
                                        Plugin.</span></p>
                        <h4 id="installwordpressplugin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Install a WordPress
                                        Plugin</span></h4>
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to install WordPress plugins:</span></p>
                        <ol>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download the plugins as
                                                Zip files from
                                                WordPress.org and upload them via the plugins section of your admin
                                                dashboard.</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find them in the Admin
                                                Dashboard plugin
                                                section and install them directly.</span></li>
                        </ol>
